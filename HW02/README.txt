Our program copies the entire dictionary file into memory for the server. We know this isn't at all memory efficient, but memory management wasn't the point to the assignment and we wanted to devote our time elsewhere.

All points of setting up the server are error checked and there is nothing the user could send (I don't think), that could cause the server to have an error. The length of the user's guess is checked and the guesses and dictionary are both converted to lower case so there would not be any conflict there.
